# PyBer Ride-Sharing Data by City Type Analysis

## Overview
The analysis herein is regarding the data provided via city_data.csv and ride_data.csv files. The task was the summarize the ride-sharing data with a breakdown for each city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural). To finalize the analysis, a graph is being provided as well to visually represent the weekly fares by each of the three city types.


## Results
According to the analysis completed, it appears that Urban city types see the highest number of rides, drivers and fares which is to be expected. The second highest in all categories was Suburban, followed by Rural.

When an average fare per driver was calculated, it was noted that Rural city types pay the highest fares with Suburban in second and Urban last.  This outcome is expected as basic supply and demand. The number of rides is inversely related to the cost of fare. When the number of rides goes up, the cost of fare goes down.

The average fare per ride was the highest for Rural city types. with Suburban coming in second and Urban with the lowest average fare per ride.

Graphed here is the total fare by each city type. It's quite clear that Rural has the lowest total fares while Urban has the highest total fares. It might be that Urban dwellers are less likely to have a vehicle and it's more cost effective for them to use ride-sharing as a means of transportation in comparison to their Rural counterparts.

## Summary
Based upon the results of this analysis, the following are business recommendations to address any disparities among the city types.

1. In an effort to boost rides in Suburban city types, a futher analysis may be preferred to determine peak ridership times. A reduction in rates may boost ridership during these peak times which may potentially be seen during nights and weekends.

2. It appears that there is not a lack of ridership within the Urban city types. It may be worth investigating whether more drivers can be added to further increase ridership as the data certainly shows there's not a lack of riders residing within Urban city types.

3. In an effort to boost ride-shares to Rural city types, larger vehicles may be worth considering for ridership to accommodate bigger groups or sharing a ride-share. Ride-sharing companies have an opportunity to help reduce the number of alcohol related accidents by providing an easily accessible option. If Rural riders are travelling to the Urban city types for a night out this is an opportunity for ride-sharing to increase rides to Rural city types.
